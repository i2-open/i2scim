# There are a few things to be aware of when creating an entry point
# 
#  - A valid entrypoint is jar package specific (see 'quarkus.package.type')
#  - A valid entrypoint depends on the location of both the launching scripts and the application jar file. To that
# end it's helpful to remember that when 'fast-jar' packaging is used, all necessary application jars are added to
# the '/work' directory and that the same
# directory is also used as the working directory. When 'legacy' or 'uber-jar' are used, the application jars
# are unpacked under the '/app' directory
# and that directory is used as the working directory.
#  - Even if the 'jvmArguments' field is set, it is ignored completely
# 
#
# When this is not set, a proper default entrypoint will be constructed.

#  - 'mongodb+srv://' is a required prefix for this format.
#  - 'username:password@' are optional. If given, the driver will attempt to login to a database after
# connecting to a database server. For some authentication mechanisms, only the username is specified and the
# password is not, in which case the ":" after the username is left off as well
#  - 'host' is the only required part of the URI. It identifies a single host name for which SRV records
# are looked up from a Domain Name Server after prefixing the host name with '"_mongodb._tcp"'. The
# host/port for each SRV record becomes the seed list used to connect, as if each one were provided as host/port
# pair in a URI using the normal mongodb protocol.
#  - '/database' is the name of the database to login to and thus is only relevant if the
# 'username:password@' syntax is used. If not specified the "admin" database will be used by default.
#  - '?options' are connection options. Note that if 'database' is absent there is still a '/'
# required between the last host and the '?' introducing the options. Options are name=value pairs and the
# pairs are separated by "&amp;". Additionally with the mongodb+srv protocol, TXT records are looked up from a
# Domain Name Server for the given host, and the text value of each one is prepended to any options on the URI
# itself. Because the last specified value for any option wins, that means that options provided on the URI will
# override any that are provided via TXT records.
